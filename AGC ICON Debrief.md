Notes:
- Kayla really wants to get the raw mP values from the ICON for further analysis to compare to re-calculated standard curve.
- Kayla was able to generated a pick list of ~65 clones based on confluence and titer form the evaluation.
- ~35 clones have been moved to the shake flask stage and have had titers performed on the Octet.
- Kayla and her team were very impressed with the speed capabilities of the ICON!
