- Hassan to help Reza get to where he needs to be both in confidence and in technical knowledge.
- Hassan to look into the variable structure in pay:
  - KPI

  - Training records
  - Email templates for common technical problems and questions
  - Streamline processes for service and applications.
- **Create a document of questions to ask the customer to help identify ongoing issues with the greatest degree of Candor**
