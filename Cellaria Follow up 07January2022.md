# Cellaria Follow Up 07January2022

## Attendees:
- Ben Duckless
- Jake Issacs
- Dima Shvartsman (Cellaria)

## Meeting Notes:
- David Deems did not attend today's meeting.
- Cellaria interested in testing the system for iPSCs, primary T Cells, and tumor model lines.
- Specific projects include seeding healthy and mutated iPSCs to be grown to spheroids.
- No plan to share iPSC donor Information with Advanced Instruments but will allow us access to the imaging data.
- **Dima wants to test 8-10 total cell types**
  - This will have to talked down to something more reasonable.
  - Dima wants to seed 1-2 plates per cell type.
  - Multiple seed dates will be needed.
  - **Logistics need to be conferred with Ian before proceeding**
- Dima assured us that the doubling times of his cells are between 20-30 hours.
- Dima currently has his techs performing manual seeding for cross-comparison.
- ultimate goal will be to scale the clones produced in the seed run into 24/6 well formats-> he's concerned with incubator space if we are to seed more than 2 plates per cell type.
- **Dima wants to use Cellaria's in house Laminin product to grow their iPSCs and not Matriclone**
  - they partnered with a UK based company to develop this product which he mentioned we could explore to validate in our system.

## Action Items:
- Dima to send Customer deck to us next Monday
- Ben to send VIPS product information and iPSC seeding information.
- Jake to check with Ian regarding the next steps with this customer.
- Ben to develop an evaluation plan.
