ICON Review Meeting Notes Tuesday 11/30/2021
- Ben H. to circulate FAQ Document produced by Genmab relating to the IT infrastructure requirements of the ICON/Studius
- Ben H. to remove the Microscope and Price line from ICON quotes and Price Documents.
- Paul needs to adjust quotes to 23andMe/ Wheeler labs to reflect recent changes to Microscope line items in instrument quotes.
- Moving forward it's critical to export the screen shots of ICON titer results for Presenting purposes.
- Ben H./ Emma hosted UCB on site for VIPS/CM/ICON demonstration.  Key Take Aways:
  - Tough to demonstrate full capabilities of the STUDIUS software without the analyze node.
  - Standard samples prepared contained Phenol Red (Results were skewed)
  - The customer had a tough time understanding the concepts of the FP assay (Ensure the concept is fully understood during the qualification calls)
  - UCB had to utilize their own IgG1 molecule to produce the standard curve.
  - UCB really liked the VIPS instrument!
- It's important for us to understand and convey the effects of Media in the assay system.
- George stressed the importance to produce proper Cell Metric confluence results prior to importing the data to Studius.
- The Apps and Sales team need to better align on the proper elements that are to be included in the evaluation.
- Jake brought up the concern for culture with media containing phenol red the titer results will change dramatically from day 0 to day 14.
- Need to convey to customers the importance of not culturing their cells with Phenol red.
- Ben H. stressed the importance of ensuring the Cell viability assessment practices are either used as a stand alone or in conjunction with established counting methods (need to finalize the comparison pre-evaluation.)
- Emma will be locking down the 1 day demo scripts.
- 20% of our current customers have both the VIPS and Cell Metric.
-Ian is concerned with why we went off script (using media with Phenol Red)
- Need to establish a confluence threshold for ICON evaluations-> Ian suggested at least 30-40%
- Important to check the specs of the instrument once its shipped to back to Norwood.
- Is it possible to set up onsite evaluations at Norwood?
- ICON will not be heavily featured at SLAS.
- Would it be possible to have a live link form SLAS booth to the lab?
- Emma and Camilla to perform VIPS to studius end to end evaluation with Filming.
- A third party may need to perform filimg and editing.
- Webinars are needed to push interest in Q1.
- no orders or opportunities in November.
